GMR Saliency Map
===

The c++ code is for paper "Saliency Detection via Graph-Based Manifold Ranking" by Chuan Yang, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu, Xiang Ruan and Ming-Hsuan Yang. To appear in Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2013), Portland, June, 2013.

***************************************************************************
The code is tested on Windows XP with Visual Studio 2008, using Opencv 2.4.3,
and on MacOS X 10.9.5 with GNU C++ Compiler, using OpenCV 2.4.9.
**************************************************************************
We use the SLIC superpixel code from "http://ivrg.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/RK_SLICSuperpixels/index.html".

*Note: The results in the paper is generated by the MATLAB code. The results by this c++ code may be somewhat different from the results by the MATLAB code.
